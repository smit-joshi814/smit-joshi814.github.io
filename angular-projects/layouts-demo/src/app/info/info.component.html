  <h1>Layout Types</h1>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Fixed Layout</h2>
    <p>A fixed layout has a fixed width and does not change with the viewport size. This ensures that the layout remains
      the same across different screen sizes, which can be useful for designs that require a constant width.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Fluid Layout</h2>
    <p>A fluid layout stretches to fit the container, adapting to the width of the screen. This type of layout is useful
      when you want the content to always fill the width of the browser window.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Flexible Layout</h2>
    <p>A flexible layout adjusts to the size of the viewport and its content. It is commonly used when you want elements
      to resize and adapt based on available space.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Responsive Layout</h2>
    <p>A responsive layout changes based on the screen size, providing an optimal view on various devices. This approach
      uses media queries and flexible grid systems to ensure content is displayed correctly across different screen
      sizes.</p>
